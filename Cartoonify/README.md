🎨 Cartoonify

## 📝 Project Description
Cartoonify is a Python-based project that converts images into cartoon-style effects using OpenCV and machine learning techniques. 
This project applies image processing techniques such as edge detection and bilateral filtering to transform real-world images into 
cartoon-like visuals.

## 📌 Features
- Converts any image into a cartoon-style effect 🎭
- Uses OpenCV for image processing 🖼️
- Simple interface 🖥️
- Easy to use ✅

## 🛠️ Requirements
This project uses the following libraries:
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

Install them manually using:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
```

## 📊 How It Works
1️⃣ Load Image → Read the input image using OpenCV.
2️⃣ Edge Detection → Detect edges using adaptive thresholding.
3️⃣ Reduce Colors → Apply bilateral filtering for a smooth cartoon effect.
4️⃣ Combine → Merge edges with the smoothed image for the final output.
